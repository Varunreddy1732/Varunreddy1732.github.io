				India is the world's third largest producer and third largest consumer of electricity.The national electric grid in India has an installed capacity of 368.79 GW as of 31 December 2019. Renewable power plants, which also include large hydroelectric plants, constitute 34.86% of India's total installed capacity. During the 2018-19 fiscal year, the gross electricity generated by utilities in India was 1,372 TWh and the total electricity generation (utilities and non utilities) in the country was 1,547 TWh. The gross electricity consumption in 2018-19 was 1,181 kWh per capita. In 2015-16, electric energy consumption in agriculture was recorded as being the highest (17.89%) worldwide. The per capita electricity consumption is low compared to most other countries despite India having a low electricity tariff.<br><br>

India has a surplus power generation capacity but lacks adequate distribution infrastructure. To address this, the Government of India launched a program called "Power for All" in 2016. The program was accomplished by December 2018 in providing the necessary infrastructure to ensure uninterrupted electricity supply to all households, industries, and commercial establishments. Funding was made through a collaboration between the Government of India and its constituent states.<br><br>

India's electricity sector is dominated by fossil fuels, in particular coal, which during the 2018-19 fiscal year produced about three-quarters of the country's electricity. The government is making efforts to increase investment in renewable energy. The government's National Electricity Plan of 2018 states that the country does not need more non-renewable power plants in the utility sector until 2027, with the commissioning of 50,025 MW coal-based power plants under construction and addition of 275,000 MW total renewable power capacity after the retirement of nearly 48,000 MW old coal-fired plants.<br><br>
India is the world’s fifth largest electricity generator with total installed capacity of 2,28,722 MW. Out of this, 90,062 MW is from state owned utilities, 72,927 MW is from privately owned utilities and 65,733 MW is from central owned utilities. The pace of investment from private players is considerable which shows an encouraging environment for the electricity sector.

India’s energy demand has been growing rapidly in the last two decades. This demand has been boosted by industrial growth as well as a rise in household consumption. On the other hand, supply of energy too has grown but has been outstripped by demand. India derives most of its electricity from fossil fuels; primarily from coal (India has 20,381 MW of capacity on coal which is 59% of total capacity). India also derives considerable amount of electricity from hydro power sources.<br><br>

Currently, India has total 1,55,969 MW of installed capacity on thermal, 39,788 MW of installed capacity on hydro, 28,184 MW of installed capacity on Renewable Energy Sources (RES) and  4,780 MW of installed capacity on nuclear. Thermal sources contribute 68% in the total capacity. Read more on Top five states in India with highest renewable energy capacity.<br> </P>
